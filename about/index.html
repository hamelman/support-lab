    <h1>ðŸ’¡ About Sean</h1>
    <p><span class="highlight">Building support systems that work better â€” for customers <em>and</em> teams.</span></p>

    <p>I'm Sean, a customer experience leader, builder, and consultant with a track record of launching high-impact support tools, teams, and operations. Over the past 10+ years, Iâ€™ve worked across startups and scaling organizations â€” from building global contact centers to redesigning support workflows with automation, data, and a human-first mindset.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™ve led teams through hypergrowth, platform transitions, and AI transformations. I believe great support doesnâ€™t just solve problems â€” it builds trust, loyalty, and scalable infrastructure for the business.</p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Operational Strategy</strong> â€“ Scalable support systems, Zendesk architecture, AI-assisted workflows</li>
      <li><strong>Team Leadership</strong> â€“ Hiring, coaching, and growing high-performing global support teams</li>
      <li><strong>CX Automation</strong> â€“ No-code tools, AI evaluation, and automation that enhances teams</li>
      <li><strong>Hands-On Consulting</strong> â€“ I build solutions, not just recommendations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Bit More Human</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™ve been the person rebuilding a support center with limited tools, the one explaining AI metrics to the exec team, and the one leading a project from pitch to postmortem. When Iâ€™m not in ops mode, Iâ€™m usually:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Experimenting with gluten-free baking that <em>actually</em> tastes good</li>
      <li>Exploring international cuisine with my partner Erin</li>
      <li>Helping my son wire his first electric guitar</li>
      <li>Building tech solutions that make work (and life) a bit less chaotic</li>
    </ul>
